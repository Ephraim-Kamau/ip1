    <h2><u>About Me</u></h2>
    <p>Background</p>
    <p>I was previously studying in JKUAT pursuing a degree in Computer Techology which
      I was able to acquire and graduate with last year. I have some job experience having
      worked in a few organizations doing data entry. More information is contained in my resume
      whose link has been provided below.</p>
      <p>I decided to join Moringa School so that I could gain and enhance my ICT skills, given that I
        never wanted to pursue a second degree. I may as well call this course my second degree.</p>
